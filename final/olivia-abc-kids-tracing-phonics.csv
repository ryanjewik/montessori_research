2023-10-26 19:07:49,"First, I‚Äôm willing to change my review here, however, I‚Äôd like the app developer to delete the ‚Äúour story‚Äù from the homepage and embed it someplace else on this app. my son used to love letter tracing on this app. But since the app developer has embedded the ‚Äúour story‚Äù video on this app and all their apps homepages/s, all my son does is click on this video over and over again. I have intentionally deleted you tube from our electronic devices. He thinks he is watching a you tube video. I was actually so happy that my son was, before recently, learning his alphabet and connecting the words to everyday objects. This is a deal breaker for me, i‚Äôd rather just pay for the app then have to keep being subjected to watching this video repeatedly. It‚Äôs ruining the app experience for me. I‚Äôm very close to just deleting all the apps from our electronic devices. Which is just such a send because up until recently, I really liked and was very loyal to these apps. This is been a significant game changer, and that our son will just not stop watching this video to the point that I‚Äôve memorized probably all of the script. Very annoying.",1,False,Delete ‚Äúour story‚Äù,Rhudy26,
2020-02-22 18:05:15,"I‚Äôm pretty picky when it comes to screen time for my toddler. Here‚Äôs why this app makes the cut:
- educational - my 2 year old is quickly learning to trace letters
- no ads!!!
- full version is free, not just one or two letters
- to close out of a particular activity, the x is faded and you have to click and drag it. This helps my son stick with the activity rather than always being tempted to click the red button and get mad when the game disappears.
- requires just the right amount of accuracy - needs to be close but doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly in the lines
- fun rewards - verbal encouragement (my son quickly started saying ‚Äúwell done‚Äù), stickers (very exciting for a 2 year old), and presents (he doesn‚Äôt care as much about these but gets excited when it‚Äôs a ball or drum or something else he recognizes and likes)
- Parents can adjust settings to meet the needs of their child
- Activities for different ability levels - some activities are perfect for him right now, others will be perfect for him down the road

2021-07-01 02:53:36,"To the Developers: thank you for putting your heart and soul into this app. Our 2 year old starting using this app a month ago and he now can correctly pick out 70% of letters and can tell them out of order. He loves Lucas and Ruby and asks us to play with his ‚Äúfwends‚Äù. The positive nature of the app is so special. He now walks around and says Good Job‚Äù ‚ÄúYou Did It‚Äù.

Preschools don‚Äôt  teach the strokes because it‚Äôs not a requirement but in K and 1 st when the teachers show the correct strokes for each letters, the students  don‚Äôt really pay attention because they have been writing for a while and think they are making them correctly.

I could also choose 1 or more letters to practice. Previously, the best thing is I could set the kid to practice the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù and press the next arrow. After 3 tries they would earn a gift or sticker. Now the app no longer lets us go to the next - I have to back out completely and restart in between each and every try, which means the kid no longer earns a reward after 3 successful attempts. This is upsetting to the child, because I have to take the tablet to set it up, and because there is no longer a reward. With the next ability the app was amazing.
