We now use this app daily as a supplement to what they are learning in school. I have a 3 and 6 year old and both of them have their own profile and things we are working on. My 6 year old is learning how to read and he loves reading the books on the app out loud to me. My 3 year old is learning her letter sounds and this app actually pronounces the letter sound correctly for her. Super impressed by that as I haven‚Äôt found that to be common practice with education all apps - even on leap frog academy. The app is very intuitive to use and easy for my kids. I appreciate this because I can leave them to work on it independently or work alongside them - whichever I choose. Again, this is hard to come by. I also love how they get still get challenged by the lessons and actually grow and learn without feeling left discouraged. It gently nudges them if they get something incorrect. The math portion is wonderful as well and something I will be exploring more of. We have only had the app a week and there is SO much we can use this for. I felt compelled to leave a review already for the amount we have already used and enjoyed Khan Academy. Download this without hesitation for your child. You won‚Äôt regret it.",5,False,Wow!

Our school district listed Khan Academy as a resource to use when schools began closing in March. We used it in addition to her other school work during that time. 

We decided to try this app for our son that is preschool age but needs just a little more time before introduction to a public setting and teachers; he‚Äôs our spirited one. Our son (age 4) LOVES this app, he willingly selects Khan Academy when we give him screen time. He actually stays engaged for long periods of time and has fun doing it. He uses the information learned from his lessons and applies it to his toys or in real life settings. He‚Äôs even begun to read short stories!! 

In conclusion, my personal opinion is that this app is amazing. If you have children that are already in school and need a little something to stay engaged; get this app. If you have a wild tornado child (our son) that has shown interest in learning but they are not quite ready to be put into a school setting; get this app. They go at their own pace and advance to the next subject after mastering the first. They also offer additional resources on the website for your kids, such as circle time videos, free printable worksheets. I wish more educational websites/apps worked like Khan Academy! Again, my own personal opinion and each family/child is different, but Khan Academy is a perfect fit for us.",5,False,A+ app for kids!,keeperofthecookies

I have tried subscription based education programs similar to this. My kids liked Khan Academy better. It‚Äôs more engaging, has the same content quality and it is super cute too. You know how some of the educational stuff for young kids out there is just kinda.. cringy? Makes you scrunch up your face and you can‚Äôt look away?? Khan isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a nice bonus..

I added my youngest on there probably around 18 months. His older siblings got screens, he wasn‚Äôt going to tolerate being left out. So might as well make it something productive, right? I was curious to see how it would make activities interactive for such a young age group. The lowest age group, I think, is designed for 2 years old. It was definitely just blindly poking every option on the screen at first, but now that he‚Äôs nearly 2 he can definitely get through the activities by himself much easier. My oldest doesn‚Äôt really use it anymore, but I credit this app for helping him learn to read. When he entered kindergarten, he was evaluated and found to be, at least, 2nd grade reading level.

The apps are the same for every kid.  

Khan Academy Kids is not like that. You can pick the difficulty level to match your kid‚Äôs ability which is awesome. I set up two profiles for my daughter. One set at kindergarten level that she can use in her own, and one at 1st grade level that she can do with a bit of monitoring if she gets stuck. It‚Äôs awesome. 

The whole experience is designed to promote learning in a way that‚Äôs engaging for kids but not silly. Everything has been designed with purpose. There are so many small details that I‚Äôve noticed in the app that help my daughter get unstuck.

But... the problem is that most activities are loaded from their servers and even if you have a very fast connection; their servers are overwhelmed because this is such a popular and super amazing app, especially being FREE; that millions of parents around the world use it constantly.

We love the app so much that we are now recurring monthly contributors to khan kids. One suggestion for developers is to be able to increase the pool of words that feature in the word puzzles or allow parents to increase difficulty level once kids have aced a certain section of the learning.

The positive points are that the interface is adorable and clearly a lot of effort went into the UI development. However, I wish they had spent as much time planning out the learning as they did the UI. This is not a platform that you would use to TEACH a child skills. This is a platform you would instead use to quiz a child on skills they already learned elsewhere. 

For example, in an actual snapshot of seconds they show a bunch of animals lined up for ice cream and say, very quickly, ‚ÄúThis one is first, this one is second, this one is third, and this one is fourth. Which one is third?‚Äù If a child had never before been introduced to the concept of sequencing, then that is definitely not enough of an introduction for the child to answer that question correctly. Lots of tears will be witnessed. 

Also, I feel there a better job could have been done of assessing a child‚Äôs skills at the start. The only thing they ask is age and then they put your child in the ‚Äúgrade‚Äù that a typically developing child would be at that age. Not all children are typical, and those of us without typically developing children are looking for extra tools to help us along the way.",2,False,This is for quizzing‚Ä¶not for learning,CertifiedMoxie

My child has a special interest in letters, but he is way beyond letters. I give him the app, that is all he will do unless I guided access block areas of the screen to deny him from endlessly repeating the same activities over and over. The result is, the guided access screen area restrict ions are cover half the screen where he can‚Äôt play any activities at all. Suggestions before I can give a 5 star: put the grade level restriction tab in the parents menu rather than where kids can have access. Allow me to turn off all tabs individually from the parent menus. Remove letter books from the books tab, they belong in the letters tab. Also, improve the parent access prompts beyond just swipe up and down, because kiddos can read. Parent access prompts such as single digit and double digit multiplication options work well at blocking my kiddo in his other apps. Also, don‚Äôt prompt for parents birth year, there was a 1:10 chance of my kiddo guessing an appropriate birth year and now he puts 1969 in all similar prompts.

My son is 3 but already knows all his letters and phonics and numbers 1-20 so I like that I can switch around to different age levels to pick something that will be new for him. I had paid for a different learning app where it made him follow a path and do every activity in order to move forward. I only allow him really limited screen time so I want to be really intentional in what he is learning and I like that this app allows me to do that.
My biggest suggestion for improvement would be to have some sort of questionnaire at the start for parents to input what things their kids already know and what skills they would like to focus on and then have the app suggest particular activities.

Listening to the activities, I wondered if she would understand how to move objects on the screen, or understand what the instructions were saying. So I went into the menu and changed it to an alphabet activity. I selected the uppercase A one; at first it was asking to pop any bubbles with the letter A in it, praising successes and gently correcting any mishaps. So far so good.
