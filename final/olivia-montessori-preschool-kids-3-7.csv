2020-04-13 14:24:53,"I downloaded this for my 3 year old to do at home. He usually attends a bilingual Montessori school. I figured I’ll let the trial period transfer to the monthly subscription if he liked it. Much to my disgust, I discovered that the trial automatically transfers to a $65/year annual subscription instead of the monthly subscription. I wasn’t even given an option to choose monthly or annual. Totally unethical! Who does that? Now that I’ve already been charged I know they won’t want to refund me at all even though I cancelled it. They count on people not noticing this so they can charge you the full amount. 

I wouldn’t mind the $65 charge so much if I thought the app was worth it, but it’s not. It’s not very intuitive on what are the actual activities vs what’s random stuff in the classroom that just makes sounds. Also, why is there not cursive hand writing lessons in this app? That’s part of the core Montessori learning experience. My friend recommended Kahn Academy Kids to me as a 100% free alternative (no trial). It loads faster, has better content, and has a more intuitive layout. I would rather pay $65/year for that than for this Montessori Preschool app. 

If I was refunded the annual fee less a 1 month subscription fee I would consider changing my review to 4 stars.",1,False,Trial to subscription is misleading,Priskittles,"{'id': 14658296, 'body': 'Hello, we’re sorry to hear that you don’t like our app. The choice between monthly and yearly is made when you start the free trial, everything is explained.

The subscription cost is absurdly high when you consider how many apps offer at least SOME of this type of content for free. The preview they offer isn’t enough to entice me into doing a free trial, especially when it seems “free trials” for apps are meant to dupe people into paying the subscription. I didn’t see ANY promise of continued content being produced, so why would someone do a monthly or yearly subscription? That’s like a textbook book, with a finite amount of content, coming with a monthly subscription rate. Umm, no thanks. I might pay a flat rate for it if the preview made it look worth it, but it definitely doesn’t seem worth subscribing. My daughter is 2.5 years old and she’d be done with all the matching, sorting, color, shapes and a couple other things in the preview after about an hour.

2020-05-08 03:37:07,Our daughter loves this app!! We originally signed her up when she was 3 yrs old but she’s still loving it at 4 too. There’s practical play along with basic Montessori principles. Simple visual and auditory aids are such a nice break from the fluorescent colors and loud sounds which usually accompany children’s games and apps. We’ve also printed out the PDFs that come with the app for her to color and she loves it. Upon switching devices we had a problem and reached out to customer service which was extremely quick to reply and very helpful to solve our issue.

I was charged before I realized it but when I did (the next day) I cancelled and requested a refund. I was denied twice. I have been told the only resolution is to file a dispute with my bank, after which point I will be locked out of my App Store account. Customer service with Apple provides no resolution and I was told it was an automated system that denied my refund request and that there is no human process to override it. What horrible customer service from Apple, but also how on earth can a kids app not come with understanding that kids might make an accidental purchase and quick refunds not be provided in that instance?

I Downloaded this app in search of educational content for my 4yr old during the pandemic. I was aware of the trial period however the way that it is pitched is very misleading. I was automatically enrolled into the one year subscription that the app provides at an absurd price for what is offered. I was not given the opportunity to select the one month subscription prior to paying $64. I also see that this app is very active in responding to its customers.

2023-04-01 12:47:24,"Un immense boulot mis dans cet app et ça se voit. Toutefois la version pour iPad est plein loin d’offrir une expérience agréable en tout cas dans la version que nous avons. Le chargement de l’app et de chaque activité est très long. Ensuite seul quelques activités s’ouvrent sans problème pour le principale math et apprendre à lire je suis éjectée systématiquement. Cela dis sur iPhone pas de soucis mais alors cets bien trop petit comme format pour 3 ans. Ensuite sur les activités en elle même, certaine sont intéressante mais j’imagine que c’est normal, d’autre trop facile car trop d’aides comme pour la dictée muette.

2023-02-03 21:38:44,"I’ve subscribed and downloaded and redownloaded several times. My kids love this game and play it on an iPad and iPhone, but no matter what we do it keeps getting stuck on a loading screen with just the sky and clouds on the screen. We can hear the game if we tap on the screen and it makes me put in my birth year if I tap the blank corners where the buttons should be but it shows nothing but that cloud loading screen. We keep having to close it out completely and re-open it, but it happens every single time they play this game. They get so frustrated and just want to play the game. I’ve emailed about it and was told it’s odd to have this problem and it hasn’t been reported before. Well I reported it and it hasn’t been fixed. I was told this game is “broken” when I asked if they could fix the bug. We were waiting for the update to come out in January but it didn’t fix that problem. I’m tired of paying for a game that doesn’t work properly. Please, please fix this bug since this is actually a great app. I’ve tried everything from unsubscribing, deleting the app, hard reboots of the devices and updates. Nothing works so it must be an issue with the code.",3,False,Bug issues,Starvingartists88,"{'id': 34779581, 'body': 'Hello, We are sorry about that.
