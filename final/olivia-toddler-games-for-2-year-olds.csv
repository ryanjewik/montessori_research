2020-12-05 07:46:57,"We picked this app up for our little man and he seems to like it a lot. The app has a sort of initial free-trial period where your kids can try it out and, if they like it, you then purchase the full content in the app. So there is nothing to really think about and you can just give it a try with no commitments. The animals are pretty cute and the voice actors and sounds are all very pleasant. It does not share the shortcoming of some games where the repetitive noises start to become irritating to hear, but that may just be a personal preference and slight bonus for us. What is really important is, as we said earlier, our little man really seems to enjoy it and his opinion is what really matters!

2020-04-28 19:37:40,Not very informative for 2-3 year olds. It‚Äôs a little lazy. Needs more than popping bubbles while the app says names of things. Just a bad purchase. Toddlers like to use their whole hand. Even when just pointing to something. They don‚Äôt realize the iPad isn‚Äôt paper so they rest the side of their hand while they point. This causes the app to freak out and repeat over over and back and forth. ‚ÄúEggplant cabbage eggplant cabbage egg eggplant cabbage.‚Äù So then they don‚Äôt know what is what. I‚Äôm not trying to teach them how sensitive technology is. I just want my kid to learn shapes and fruits and veggies on the go sometimes.

2020-11-30 06:19:48,If you are touching the screen with one finger it freezes the screen. So if your toddler is holding the phone and their thumb on their left hand happens to be touching the screen where they are holding the phone/tablet they won‚Äôt be able to use their other index finger to drag items around on the screen. Might work for an older toddler who you can explain that too but for my 20 month old (who has other similar games and understands the concept of dragging items to the intended spot) it is just very frustrating to have the screen frozen because she is touching the bottom corner with her thumb. All the toddlers games we have on the tablet took that into consideration and support multi touch on the screen.,1,False,Only supports one finger touch,jenn4schur,
