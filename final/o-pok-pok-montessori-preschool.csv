I highly recommend this app to parents everywhere. We try to be very intentional about what our kids are doing on devices, and this Pok Pok app hit all the right points for us and our kids. It truly does what it says - it empowers kids to explore and experiment. It's beautifully designed, it's calming. We've noticed our kids don't get addicted to it in the way other apps do, so it's easier for them to put it down when it's time. Our 3 year-old loves playing in the city scape mode and just clicking around to see which things were interactive - nearly everything is which is just awesome - and there were definitely some things he clicked on that made him smile or laugh. Our 5yo girl gravitates heavily to all the art stuff and she loves pretend play and the dress up / character based play. Our 5yo boy basically follows his sister's lead, but also enjoyed a couple other parts of the app I didn't see his sister playing with. And the main thing I wanted to call out with our 8 year-old is that he normally has a really difficult time putting down the iPad, but that wasn't the case with this app. He didn't have as hard of a time saying goodbye to it as he does with some of the other apps we let him use, which is just great.",5,False,WebbK,Beautifully Designed / Big Hit with my 4 kids (ages 3-8),pok-pok-montessori-preschool,1

I was pretty sure those two things were mutually exclusive but I thought I’d give it a try for my 3 year old. Something new to keep him busy while I do school with his older siblings. Something that would hopefully engage the mood of our school day without disruptive and distracting explosions, car races, or painful nerve grating songs. I must say this app did not disappoint. It engages him in a way that isn’t overstimulating or disregulating and has enough content to keep him interested. I was very pleased. It did what I wanted it to do. Because the app utilizes the family share option (thank you!) it loaded on every iPad in the house and later that day I noticed my 10 year old was playing it on his iPad. I asked him if he was looking at his little brother’s new game, he said, and I quote, “Oh I thought you got that for me.

I do too as it's a great opportunity for me to sit down with him and label the objects he is tapping on. He is largely nonverbal so any way that I can work on words with him that is fun is very welcome. He also really loves the music box. They have some really cool music to choose from, which is right up his alley. One more thing I will say is that the colors are muted which is absolutely lovely.

Edited to add 3 weeks later: Be careful when using this app. My kids don’t ever let me have my phone anymore. I initially got the app for my 2 year old daughter.

It’s thrilling to see a game that is so thoughtful about kids’ intelligence and how to portray game characters of different genders, races, and physical abilities. 

Most of the comments here focus on the subscription model. I credit the Pok Pok team for committing to their vision of a children’s play space that doesn’t turn play time into a “kiddie casino.” Let’s be candid - all those freemium games descend into the 2021 equivalent of pestering a grown up with a credit card to pony up for more lives, some digital accessory, or another level.

The art is adorable and eye catching without being overly stimulating. Here is something that I think would improve this already amazing app. While I do love how many different activities/games/""toys"" there are, I do think that our human race is vulnerable to the paradox of choice. It is easy for us to get overwhelmed when we have too many choices, and each individual choice starts to feel less special and exciting. This is why I love the concept of toy rotation: having only a few options available at one time, and periodically rotating out different options.  I would love the option to do this in the app - for the grownup to be able to choose which activities are available on the main screen, and to be able to change these out as they please.

There are so many choices within the app which gives him a sense of control, which is so helpful. It is interactive but without “wrong” choices, which is also huge for him. It has lots of different visual input but is not overstimulating, which can be rare for apps. It is also a calming and grounding tool for him to help regulate him if he’s gotten dysregulated. I like that he is able to practice some fine motor control in a fun way using a screen. I also really like that they change up the games within the app now and then to keep him engaged - because he certainly notices every tiny little tweak!

I was reluctant to believe that any app could be appropriate for a kid that young, but Pok Pok has allayed my fears. I love seeing what my kid picks and how she plays with the toys, I love that it doesn’t talk to her (no ads!) or try to coax her toward trying to do anything, I love the sound design and all the little surprises that await. Most kid-oriented apps or videos are kind of annoying, but it is genuinely nice to be around Pok Pok. It’s more like a toy chest than a video game. We’ve been playing with it for a couple of months and my kid has continued to enjoy it and find new ways to play with it. It looks like it would be good for kids that are older too, with some toys that are more complex (like a sound board or a marble run) that my toddler just kind of mashes her hands around on but an older kid would probably enjoy fiddling with.

The fact that he can use both hands to interact with the games is a huge plus too, as it is more intuitive for him.
Obviously the biggest barrier for a lot of users is the price - on the one hand it is a fairly expensive app compared to others, but I would say that the incredible quality of the app and the lack of ads or constant prompts to buy things makes it worth it.

Pok Pok is really different from the digital games I see my nieces and nephews playing. It’s really engaging for our 3-year-old. The audio is very pleasant. The games on Pok Pok are more like different sets of toys. Each toy/game is designed in such a way that even a small child can interact with it and enjoy it, while older kids can figure out more of the details of making it “work”. 

We typically offer our toddler Pok Pok in the car and in restaurants, places where bringing other toys is impractical.

We try to limit screen time, and I’ve been recently thinking about how to use tech as a tool with our 3.5 year old vs just something to avoid at all costs. We’ve been looking for an app that we not only feel comfortable with, but also feel is benefitting him instead of just passing the time. 

I was not expecting this app to do so much, look so nice, or spark so much creativity in our little guy! 

When they say each part of the app is like a virtual “toy”… they aren’t kidding! Marble run, drawing, dress up, pretend play, you name it! 

I’m impressed with how much intention has gone into every aspect of the app. This might sound dramatic but this made me rethink what technology can be for my kids 🤯 I don’t feel the need to limit his use of this app at all. Just like with his toys, he comes to a natural end with what he’s playing with and wants to do something else. Sometimes it’s another toy in the app, sometimes it’s another toy in his playroom. We rarely have meltdowns when we are done with playing, and there are endless ways to play together in the app!

Our 3 yr old daughter who is also autistic immediately took to it and engaged heavily with it. Unfortunately for us, it soon became addictive for her in some areas and extremely upsetting to her in others - specifically with the “eyes” button as she didn’t like the pages transitioning automatically and favored more pages than others and there’s no way to customize that experience for her or turn off the transitioning so she can easily access the page she wanted without waiting for the timer. Her favorite buttons were usually the dress up button and the little town.

In the midst of preparing for a plane ride with my two children, I was in a frenzy trying to find any and everything to keep my 3 year old occupied while I would have my 10 month old in my lap, tending to him. I scrolled through a bunch of kid-friendly, educational apps and ended up downloading Pok Pok along with some other great, high quality learning apps that he could play while we were on the plane.
Let me tell you, my 3 year old LOVED Pok Pok during the free trial.
He ended up liking it so much that once the free trial ended, he was still talking about it.
We don’t do a lot of screen time, but it was such a fun and explorative app. I mentioned paying for another month to my husband, who was very hesitant (he doesn’t believe in paying for apps) so we left it at that.
Then about a month or so later, we got the little “play kit” in the mail that was basically stickers and another activity, as well as a handwritten note to my son from the Pok Pok team. 
My son was SO HAPPY and immediately recognized Pok Pok.
My husband was impressed and purchased the yearly subscription right after.

The app says it’s not addictive but it takes me a while to get the tablet away from my daughter. It’s definitely a good investment, I see that she is learning from the game, moving objects, dressing people, putting food in blenders, bubbles in the shower and sitting people ion the toilet, dancing with the music juke box or whatever that is, small things for me but huge steps for her. Only complaint is that I wish the “bug” world was bigger, it’s small compared to the other ones, and it needs a jungle full of animals. In short, I totally recommend this app to other parents. 

Update:  my daughter isn’t too interested like she used to be.

After initial new-toy frenzy kids calmed down, but Pol-Pok remains one of their favorite games to spend screen time allowance. 

While educational value of the game is not in-your-face to the point that 4yo calls it “the game with no purpose”, there are some cool learning opportunities for every age between 1 and 6, from doll dress-up to city building. I guess, the free-form education is just Montessori way and has its merits.  My 2yo enjoys drawing and 4yo is crazy about Dino habitat, but they both also like exploring other applets.

This game is very addictive

The promises about non-addictive and educational nature of the game did not check out so far. My 4yo threw a fit when I tried to take it away and he can’t talk about anything else ever since. I did not notice anything educational about this game either. Still, giving it a try — it seems to be good for bribes and for removing the kid from under my feet for an unspecified amount of time.
