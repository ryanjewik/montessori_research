Don't just throw your kids in front of a screen on day, but an hour of learning time helps you, helps them develop skills, and just helps them grow. Be careful of what games you let them play, but free learning games like this, that actually teach are fantastic!\",\n",

It only needs to say it once but it'll repeat the directions 1 second after it just said it. All these things are distracting to students and it makes it difficult to focus, especially for a toddler. Simple is better when it comes to noise and animation so the child can focus in what's being asked of them. It even triggers my ADD.. too much noise and distractions.\",\n",
