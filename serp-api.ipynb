They're ALL in Mandarin w/ no option to change this anywhere. My daughter doesn't have any background in Mandarin, and the games require a basic understanding of the language. I may update with more areas that could stand to be improved upon. It's a neat concept. Just wish it was better executed.

I really appreciated how it was truly personalized to my child and the lessons are really engaging and thoughtful, the app is totally fun, there are fun-filled preschool games which helps them learn along the way. Most learning apps are full of tricks to win prizes to dress up your character, this one is built around the fun of learning.',\n",

Paid for a year and got two months of use because I switched from iphone to android. Contacted Edoki several times and their solutions never worked (also no INTERACTIVE way to contact them). You have to do a deep dive in their help pages to get a contact, then once you email and they answer, that\\'s it. If you want to communicate more, you have to start over. No phone number. Nada. Go with another learning app. The two months I did have this, it got kinda stale. Reply to reply: \"Instantly\" is a bit of a stretch, and you asked which account email address to restore. I sent my reply, and a day into all this still don\\'t have resolution (an accessible paid in full account). Despite their BS about having gotten my messages, now 03/22 and still no access. Contesting via credit card. Lowering star rating.',\n",

Thankfully I watch all the games my daughter plays. It's also really laggy when pressing (and it's not the tab we bought a really good one and it's the same on every thing we have the game on) when she touches the screen it's really 50/50 if it even registers she's pressed it or not. So unfortunate because this game has so much potential. Also graphics need work.\",\n",

They're ALL in Mandarin w/ no option to change this anywhere. My daughter doesn't have any background in Mandarin, and the games require a basic understanding of the language. I may update with more areas that could stand to be improved upon. It's a neat concept. Just wish it was better executed. And, as someone else commented, it is sluggish - even on our fairly decent tablet.\",\n",

       "  'snippet': \"Agree with another comment made down below.. Really dangerous to teach little ones to shake a whole pill bottle in to their mouth!! Thankfully I watch all the games my daughter plays. It's also really laggy when pressing (and it's not the tab we bought a really good one and it's the same on every thing we have the game on) when she touches the screen it's really 50/50 if it even registers she's pressed it or not. So unfortunate because this game has so much potential. Also graphics need work.\",\n",

Takes forever to load anything (COME ON I mean this is meant for pre-schoolers, they do NOT have patience!)! And this is on a brand new Samsung phone (Sept 2020 model!) We subscribed, and now it still wants us to subscribe again! WTH! Customer help is just a FAQ!! TOTAL rubbish! Update1: TOTAL RUBBISH! Took subscription bucks AGAIN! But on my kid's device subscription is still not active! Not used AT ALL! Kid hates it!!\",\n",
