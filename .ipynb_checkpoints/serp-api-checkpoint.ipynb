       "     'description': \"Ready to play a truly free spelling game for kids❓ What about a spelling game without ads? 🚫 Did we mention we’ve got multiple spelling games all in one game? ✔️ Learning to spell is not one size fits all, that's why our free kids game includes over 10 different spelling games to play.  \\n  \\nThe perfect game for kids to learn to spell, while having fun! 🎉 The game helps young children learn to spell by sounding out words, phonics, and teaches how to associate letters with pictures. 🥰 Our goal with our collection of spelling games was to have the kids play and not realize they’ve learned to spell! ✏️\\n\\n🌟 Game Modes:\\n✔️ Spelling: A picture is shown on the screen with letters outlined just above it. Children match the letters at the top by choosing from the tiles below, placing them in the correct order to spell out words. Kids get to learn to spell while learning phonics in the process.\\n\\n✔️ Fill In Blank: Kids can spell out the name of the picture using letters on the screen. There’s just one catch, though: all the letters are jumbled up!\\n\\n✔️ Blank Spelling: Letters are placed at the bottom of the screen, but this time there’s no clue at the top!\\n\\n✔️ CVC: Consonant vowel consonant mode includes 5 additional free learning modes for kids to practice and to learn cvs’s. \\n\\nWe truly believe phonics helps build a framework for spelling. We’ve included multiple phonics focused game modes. 🔥 Our goal from the beginning is to not simply get the child to remember the spelling, but to fully learn phonics in the process as well. ⌛\\n\\nABC Spelling was designed with both adults and children in mind. 👨\\u200d👩\\u200d👧\\u200d👦  Kids will love the bright graphics, the easy to touch icons, and the fun cartoon drawings. 📝 Parents will love the report card feature that helps track learning progress. 🎯\\n\\n👉 Best of all, ABC Spelling - Spell & Phonics is absolutely free, with no third party ads, paywalls, or other distractions. 🔥\\n\\nFeatures:\\n✨ Fun, educational activities for toddlers, kids, and parents alike!\\n🎨 Colorful graphics and animations to help kids learn.\\n🎵 Sounds to help children learn phonics for letters and words.\\n📝 Report cards show learning progress.\\n🥇 Collect stickers & certificates to celebrate learning achievements!\\n\\nOur collection of spelling games are played by kids of all ages. 🧒 However, we’re always trying to improve our collection of spelling games further, thus we love reading your reviews. ⭐\\n\\nWe’ve tried to make this the best free educational spelling game in the market. 🏆 Hopefully you love our free educational game as much as we loved making it! 👉 Download the best free learn to spell game now! 🔥\"},\n",

It is totally worth it for the quality and variety of interactive and educational games, some lovely touches.',\n",

The company originally refused to issue a refund; it only agreed to the refund after I responded saying I would leave an appropriate review with a low score. The app may be worth it (my son didn't use it, so I don't know), but be SURE you want it if you sign up for the trial, or be very diligent about canceling\",\n",

So meh. Maybe we'll continue for 1 more month, if kid remains uninterested we shall unsubscribe & uninstall. Original: Get Khan Academy instead! Donate to them! DO NOT SUBSCRIBE to this cr@p! Takes forever to load anything (COME ON I mean this is meant for pre-schoolers, they do NOT have patience!)! And this is on a brand new Samsung phone (Sept 2020 model!) We subscribed, and now it still wants us to subscribe again! WTH! Customer help is just a FAQ!! TOTAL rubbish! Update1: TOTAL RUBBISH! Took subscription bucks AGAIN! But on my kid's device subscription is still not active! Not used AT ALL! Kid hates it!!\",\n",
